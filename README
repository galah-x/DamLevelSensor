A water level monitor was made to monitor a farm dam level, it seems we may be moving into another drought.

Its an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance from a fixed mount above the water, pointing down, and a arduino + LoRa radio for the datalink to the logging computer in the office. Solar powered.

The structure I live in is timber with corrugated iron for roof and wall sheeting. Thats not good for radios. So there is a radio relay on the roof relaying both RFM69 and RFM95 radio links into the office. This also provides some lightning protection.

The dam is about 0.5km from the house, LoRa can do that easily even from inside the slightly conductive black poly pipe.

Another USB motino with a radio link presents data to a linux computer, which logs the serial data and stores it in an influx database. Grafana on an internal http server then presents data to the user nicely. I don't currently use MQTT or LoRaWan.
